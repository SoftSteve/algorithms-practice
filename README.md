# Algorithms Practice

This repository contains my personal implementations of common data structures and algorithms. I use this to practice and track my progress in understanding core concepts in computer science.

## Contents
- Sorting Algorithms: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
- Search Algorithms: Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.
- Miscellaneous Algorithms: Implementations of trees, graphs, etc.

## Purpose
- Track progress and document my skillset.
- Strengthen problem-solving and coding skills.
- Serve as a reference for future projects and interviews.

Feel free to explore my solutions and improvements as I continue to add more algorithms and data structures.
